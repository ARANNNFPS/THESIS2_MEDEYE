            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>MedEye is committed to providing fast, accessible, and reliable medicine identification. Our goal is to
                bridge the knowledge gap for patients, caregivers, and health professionals through instant recognition
                and clear, trustworthy information.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Using advanced deep learning and computer vision integrated into our backend Flask API, MedEye analyzes
                images of pills or packaging and returns essential information. The current web platform is
                intentionally designed as a lightweight demonstration—showing only a fraction of MedEye’s full
                capabilities. Unlike the mobile application, which performs three layers of validation (YOLO detection,
                OCR extraction, and a heuristic verification algorithm), the web version provides a simplified preview
                so users can test and experience a portion of the system’s power..</p>
